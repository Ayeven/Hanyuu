# genericbot
A not so simple modular multi weebs query of manga/anime with discord.js v13

For starter this is a small bot that I made so I can practice learning javascript, specifically more into nodejs.

## Requirements

- `git` command line ([Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)|[Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)|[MacOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)) installed
 - `node` [Version 16 required](https://nodejs.org)


## Intents

By default `genericbot` needs the Guilds, Guild Messages and Guild Voice States intents to work.
Command(s) may not working without proper intent.

For more info about intents checkout the [official Discord.js guide page](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/intents.html) and the [official Discord docs page](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents).
